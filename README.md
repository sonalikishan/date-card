# date-card
date invitation card using bootstrap.
this is a cute date invitation card I made using bootstrap.
THE STEPS HOW I ACHIEVED THIS ARE:
1. visit the official website of bootstrap.
2.copy the CDN link
3.paste it in between the head tag.
4.visit website again, go to "read docs" and search for card option and copy the inbuilt code.
5.paste it in your HTML code.
6.create a div that contains the card HTML code.
7.use the div to center the card(easiest way to center the card is by using Flex)(I have used internal CSS for all the designs)
